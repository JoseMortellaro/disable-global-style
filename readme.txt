It disables the global style inlined by WordPress since WP 5.9.


== Description ==

It disables the global style inlined by WordPress since WP 5.9. It also removes the duotone SVGs added after the opening body tag.

Even if you don't use the full site editing, since WordPress 5.9 you will have an inlined style and some duotone SVGs added by the core on all the pages of your website.

The global inlined style is not enormous, but it's also not very little. Around 5 kB added to the document may make a difference if your document is already heavy.

Moreover, why should your page have this style if you don't need it?

Activate Disable Global Style and you will get rid of it.
